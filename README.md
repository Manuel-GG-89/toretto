# Toretto - Tore (TOtall REcall) TTo (... Toretto, The op)

This is just a re-implementation of the Tore notification tool developed by Tsoding (... The Zoding OP (I)engginer nice guy, I think).
This piece of ~~shit~~ shiny C-code uses the Nob C compiler tool created by Tzoding, an inplemetation of a Fast-&-Simple Standar Plain C (without any shiny library outside the standar Old School Plain C for Nobs like me).

You just need any Gnu-Linux desktop distro, or a WSL (Windows subsystem) distro to put this on the road.  

--> This is just the forked (first commit) code. The new code will be added soon. 

## Quick Start

```console
$ cc -o nob nob.c
$ ./nob
$ sudo cp ./build/tore /usr/local/bin/
$ echo "tore" >> ~/.bashrc
```
